Here are some suggestions for additional visuals that can help convey your message of promoting sustainability to your users:

1. Donut Chart of Plastic Usage: Create a donut chart to visually represent the percentage of plastic usage in different categories. Each category can be represented by a different color, and the size of the slices can indicate the proportion of plastic used compared to other materials.

2. Comparison of Cost Savings: Show a bar chart comparing the cost savings achieved by switching from plastic to sustainable alternatives. Display the cost savings for each category, highlighting the potential financial benefits of adopting sustainable options.

3. Environmental Impact Comparison: Create a stacked bar chart to compare the environmental impact of plastic versus sustainable materials. Show metrics such as carbon footprint, water usage, and waste generation for each category, highlighting the reduction in environmental impact by choosing sustainable alternatives.

4. Success Stories: Feature a section on your webpage dedicated to success stories of restaurant owners who have successfully transitioned to sustainable options. Include testimonials, before-and-after pictures, and specific examples of how they have reduced plastic usage and improved their sustainability practices.

5. Interactive Calculator: Develop an interactive calculator where users can input their current plastic usage in various categories, and the tool provides an estimate of the environmental impact and cost savings they can achieve by switching to sustainable alternatives. This visual can help users understand the potential benefits and motivate them to take action.

6. Progress Tracker: Implement a visual progress tracker on your webpage that allows users to track their own progress in reducing plastic usage over time. This can be displayed as a line graph or a series of progress bars, showing the decrease in plastic consumption and the corresponding positive impact on the environment.

7. Sustainable Alternatives Showcase: Create an interactive gallery or grid layout showcasing various sustainable alternatives for each category. Include images, descriptions, and information about where users can purchase or source these alternatives. This visual can inspire users with tangible options they can implement in their own establishments.

Remember to use visually appealing and intuitive designs for your visuals, ensuring that the message of promoting sustainability is clear and easily understandable.
